## Overview

The **Advanced Encryption Tool** is a lightweight and secure file encryption utility designed to protect your sensitive data. This tool employs AES-256-GCM encryption, a robust standard widely recognized for its security. With a user-friendly Tkinter-based graphical interface, users can easily encrypt and decrypt files using a password.

### Key Features

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Utilizes one of the most secure encryption standards available.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter for a simple and intuitive user experience.
- **Password Protection**: Secure your files with a password of your choice.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source, allowing for community contributions and improvements.

## FAQ

### What is AES-256-GCM?

AES-256-GCM is an encryption standard that uses a 256-bit key size and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for both encryption and authentication. This combination provides high security and performance.

### Can I use this tool for large files?

Yes, the Advanced Encryption Tool is designed to handle files of various sizes. However, performance may vary based on your system specifications.

### Is my password stored?

No, the tool does not store your password. It uses the password only for the encryption and decryption processes.

### How can I report issues?

You can report issues by navigating to the "Issues" tab in the repository and creating a new issue. Provide as much detail as possible to help us address the problem.
